# Machine Learning App

## Introduction.
<p>Since the advent of machine learning, various app, websites, blogs uses various techniques, styles to use power of AI to train and give their customer the advantage or prediction of what about to come. If a person knows what is coming, he/she can prepare for the worst and avoid the worst case. This has been made possible by various machine learning, deep learning etc. techniques. </p>

<p>With the development of machine learning with ages, various improvement, techniques has been developed to harness the power of machine learning to tachle all kinds of problems or more precisely to be used on various problems. Various techniques include- </p>

<ul>
  <li>Machine Learning</li>
  <li>Deep Learning</li>
  <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
  <li>Generative Adversarial Networks</li>
  <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
</ul>

These techniques uses different kinds of inputs and output the result, like- 
Machine Learning can be used on Tabular Structured Data, Clustering Data Points etc., 
Deep Learning can be used on Images, Videos etc.,
Natural Language Processing can be used on Text Processing, Language Translation etc.,
Generative Adversarial Network can be used to generate fake image,
Reinforcement Learning is all about self learning.

Since these techniques work on different inputs so various of these techniques can be applied to various kinds of problems to tackle/predict the best solution possible.

## What does it do ?
